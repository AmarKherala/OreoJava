## Somewhat making progress..

## Who am I, and what's Oreo.JAVA?
Hi, everyone.
I'm Ammar, mainly known as "amaroreo" in disocrd.

Oreo.JAVA is a self-hosted bot made with ❤️ using Java and [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA), the code is mini as of right now because i lost the old code, baha.

## Cloning the repo and contirbution information
- Contirbuting:
Feel free to contirbute anything, matter fact I'd LOVE it if you did.
- Cloning: 
If you cloned the repo, make sure to folloe the .env.exapmle file [right here](https://github.com/AmarKherala/OreoJava/blob/main/src%2Fmain%2Fres%2F.env.example) to be able to get your bot running with  this code.
## Goals and Intensions
- Golas:
Simple, just having a bot for my server. And learn more about java logic along the way.
- Intentions:
I intented to create the bot for funsies, when i first heard about JDA i was like "i have to get into this libary ASAP!" and i love what I'm doing honestly!
